# Mission to Mars

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to add more functionality to a web app that we worked on throughout the module. The app was meant to display information about Mars that was collected by using webscraping techniques. After scraping the data from various websites using BeautifulSoup, it was then stored in the nonrelational database MongoDB. The format for the Flask app was created using the index.html file.
